## 📱 Project Description
**University Finder** is an Android application developed as **Assignment 01** for the Mobile Programming course.  
The app demonstrates basic Android UI interaction by allowing users to select a university from a dropdown list and navigate to the university’s official website using an implicit intent.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice handling user selection using Spinner
- Update UI components dynamically based on user input
- Use implicit intents to open external web pages
- Design a simple and responsive Android UI

---

## ⚙️ How the App Works
1. The user selects a university from a **Spinner**.
2. When the **"Show University's Site"** button is clicked:
   - The corresponding university logo is displayed.
   - A website URL is assigned internally.
3. Clicking on the displayed image opens the university’s official website using an implicit intent (`ACTION_VIEW`).

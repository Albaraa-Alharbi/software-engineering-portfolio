# Algorithms Analysis – Labs

This folder contains a collection of **algorithm analysis labs** completed as part of the  
**Algorithms Analysis** course.

Labs are designed to focus on **individual algorithmic paradigms**, allowing hands-on
practice with core techniques before applying them in more complex problem-solving tasks.
